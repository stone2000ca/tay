# Tay Build — Current State

**Last updated:** 2026-05-17 (Run #003)
**Current milestone:** v0.4 (next to ship)
**Roadmap progress:** 4/10 milestones merged

## Currently in flight

(None — run #003 closed cleanly.)

## Next up

- **v0.4: Drafter v1 — type a prospect's name + company → generated draft.**
  - New `/draft` (or wizard step) where user enters a prospect's `full_name` + `company` (optionally a `notes` field for context)
  - Drafter reads the `voice_calibration` rubric (from v0.3) and the prospect inputs, calls `MODELS.quality` via `lib/llm.ts`, returns a draft email (subject + body)
  - Save the draft to a new `drafts` table (link to `prospects` row; create the prospect on-the-fly if it doesn't exist)
  - **AI disclosure footer skeleton:** even though full disclosure-mode lookup wires in v0.5/v0.7, every draft body MUST already include the disclosure footer text (e.g. "This message was written with AI assistance."). Place is a constant in `lib/draft/disclosure.ts` for v0.5 to swap to a per-jurisdiction lookup.
  - Tay gates: B (no special-category data in prospect schema), D (drafter enforces the rubric — formality, sentence length, common/avoid phrases all influence prompt construction), H (prospect inputs wrapped in `<untrusted_source>` blocks when fed to LLM)
  - Out of scope this milestone: actual sending (v0.7), judge gate (v0.5), audit log writes (v0.6). v0.4 just saves the draft and displays it.

## Blocked / awaiting input

(All previously-noted gates explicitly waived by user. Recommended but not blocking:)

- **First-user smoke test recommended** — paste real `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, calibrate voice, draft a sample email. If `anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku` 404s on the user's OpenRouter account, swap `VALIDATION_MODEL` to `openai/gpt-4o-mini`.
- **Live Supabase not yet provisioned** — three migrations (0001, 0002, 0003 coming in v0.4) all unverified against real Postgres. Mitigations: idempotent CREATE IF NOT EXISTS, transactional DDL, inline-SQL fallback.
- **Vercel project not linked to GitHub repo** — preview URLs not captured on PRs.
- **Paper cuts to address before v0.5 ship:** `/setup/voice` should surface "Supabase not configured" banner instead of wedging in a redirect loop; define `SAMPLE_COUNT` once and import in both UI and extractor.

## Recent learnings

1. `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch --repo <owner/repo>` succeeds even when `main` is checked out in another worktree. Pattern locked in for run #003+; resolves the cleanup churn from runs #001 and #002.
2. OpenRouter is OpenAI-API-compatible → drop-in via `openai` SDK pointed at `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`. One key, ~100 models. Users pick models via env vars (`OPENROUTER_MODEL_CHEAP`, `OPENROUTER_MODEL_QUALITY`) without code changes.
3. `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` is the right adversarial-input defense for LLM JSON outputs combined with a hard schema validator (`parseRubric`). System prompt should also instruct the LLM to ignore embedded instructions in untrusted inputs.
4. Multi-file migration runner pattern: a `MIGRATIONS_INLINE` map keyed by filename + per-migration sentinel pre-check (look for a known table from that migration in `information_schema`) keeps the runner idempotent without needing a migrations-tracking table.
5. Dual-backend modules (Supabase + cookie fallback) work but the "neither configured" state creates redirect-loop UX. Future milestones touching these should add a top-of-page "Supabase not configured" banner that short-circuits the loop and tells the user what to do.
6. Voice rubric is the contract for v0.4 (drafter) and v0.5 (judge). Schema header in `lib/voice/rubric-schema.ts` documents this so future maintainers don't reshape it.

## Strategic pivots logged

- **2026-05-17 (run #003):** LLM provider changed from Anthropic direct to OpenRouter (unified gateway, OpenAI-API-compatible). `lib/anthropic.ts` deleted; `@anthropic-ai/sdk` removed from package.json. Setup wizard now collects an `sk-or-` key.

## v1.0 ship gate

When v1.0 is MERGED + JOURNEYS eval suite is green + trust-tier promotion verified live:
- /tay-build surfaces "v1.0 complete. Awaiting user kickoff for post-1.0 work."
- Wait for explicit user direction
